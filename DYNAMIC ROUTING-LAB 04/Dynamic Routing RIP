# Dynamic Routing using RIP – Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates **dynamic routing** using **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** in a simulated network topology built in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

---

## 🖥️ Topology Overview

![Topology](Dynamic%20Routing%20RIP.png)

The network consists of:
- **2 Routers** (Cisco 2911)
- **2 Switches**
- **6 PCs**
- **3 Networks:**
  - `198.168.2.0/24` – Left LAN
  - `198.168.3.0/24` – Right LAN
  - `198.168.1.0/24` – Inter-router link

## ⚙️ Router Configuration (RIP)

### Router0 (Left Side)
```plaintext
enable
configure terminal
router rip
version 2
no auto-summary
network 198.168.1.0
network 198.168.2.0
exit




Router1 (Right Side)

enable
configure terminal
router rip
version 2
no auto-summary
network 198.168.1.0
network 198.168.3.0
exit


🧾 IP Addressing Summary
Device	Interface	IP Address	Subnet
Router0	Gig0/0	192.168.2.3	255.255.255.0
Router0	Gig0/1	198.168.1.2	255.255.255.0
Router1	Gig0/0	198.168.3.3	255.255.255.0
Router1	Gig0/1	198.168.1.4	255.255.255.0
PC0	Fa0	198.168.2.7	255.255.255.0
PC1	Fa0	198.168.2.9	255.255.255.0
PC2	Fa0	198.168.3.5	255.255.255.0
PC3	Fa0	198.168.3.7	255.255.255.0

🛠️ Default Gateway Settings (PCs)
Set the default gateway on each PC to the IP address of the connected router interface:

PC0 & PC1: 192.168.2.3

PC2 & PC3: 198.168.3.3

✅ Verification Commands

On routers:
show ip route
show ip protocols
ping [destination-ip]

On PCs:
ping [remote-pc-ip]

📚 Learning Objectives
Understand and configure RIP version 2

Learn about classless routing, no auto-summary, and dynamic route advertisement

Test and verify end-to-end network connectivity

📢 Notes
Make sure all router interfaces are enabled using no shutdown.

This setup uses class C private IPs with a /24 subnet.

RIP is simple but not scalable; this demo is ideal for learning purposes.
